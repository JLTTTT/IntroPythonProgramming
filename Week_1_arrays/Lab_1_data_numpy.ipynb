Just about every thing that touches a computer now has the ability to store data. Most of this data will be numbers, but sometimes it will be qualitative data (think 3 people like this, 10 people don't).\n","\n","You can do a lot of data analysis with spreadsheets, but at some point it's almost always easier to write some code to either *put* data into a spread sheet in a form that's useful, to *pull* specific data from one (or more) spreadsheets, or to automate some processes (like creating six custom plots from this month's data showing price trends). Being able to write a bit of code to clean up or re-purpose data is really useful, and not too difficult.\n","\n","- Lab week 1: Read in data, re-arrange it, and use it to do (text-based) statistical analysis\n","- Lab week 2: Plot the data you worked with in lab week 1\n","- Homework weeks 1 & 2: \n","-- Make the code more general, so you can look at different data channels\n","-- Make nicer plots\n","\n","Some notes on the data you'll be working with. This is real data captured by a robotic hand designed to pick fruit. The hand is instrumented with a couple sensors (IMUs in each of the three fingers, force and torque information at the wrist and information from the motors driving the three fingers). Each of these sensors outputs a data stream, which we've stored in a csv file. \n","\n","Big picture: We want to know if we can detect if the apple was picked or not from the sensor data. Each row of the Data/proxy_pick_data.csv file is data from a single picking trial. Each group of n columns represents one time step. We want to plot/analyze data from different data channels to see if there is a difference between the successful and unsuccessful picks.\n","\n","For this lab the goal is to pull out one data channel (the wrist torque sensor, z value) and print out statistics for failed versus successful picks. Yes, you could do all of this by manually going into the spreadsheet, sorting\n","columns, and setting up some spreadsheet formulas. That works for one data channel... but what if you want to do a different one? Or the data file format changes because someone added another sensor? Or you're asked to throw out the biggest n samples?\n","\n","Yes, this is going to be frustrating/seem like a lot of work for nothing the first time you do it. The point is not\n","to do this particularly task, but to learn how to access data in dictionaries, lists, and numpy arrays to \"pull out\"\n","data that you're interested in. Yes, I could just tell you to use numpy slicing to pull out every 15th column,\n","starting with the 3rd column, and sort by the last column, but where would the fun be in that?"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Libraries that we need to import - numpy and json (for loading the description file)\n","import numpy as np\n","import json as json"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false},"source":["## Reading in data\n","TODO First step, read in the data from Data/proxy_pick_data.csv and put it in a numpy array pick_data.
